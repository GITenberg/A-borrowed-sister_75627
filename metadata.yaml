summary: '"A Borrowed Sister" by Eliza Orne White is a children''s novel written in
  the early 20th century. The story revolves around Lois Page, an only child who is
  thrilled to welcome a "borrowed sister," Jessie Matthews, into her home while Jessie''s
  family is temporarily away. As the two girls navigate their new friendship, the
  narrative explores themes of companionship, childhood adventures, and the joys and
  challenges of sharing a living space.  At the start of the novel, Lois is excited
  about Jessie''s impending arrival and begins to prepare for her new sister''s stay,
  noting the differences between Jessie and her other friend, Ellen. While Jessie
  is calm and agreeable, Ellen has a more complex friendship with Lois due to her
  unpredictable temper. The opening chapters highlight the three girls'' interactions
  as they express their feelings about the changes in their relationships while managing
  their emotions and preparing for the addition of Jessie to their lives. This charming
  beginning sets the stage for a heartwarming exploration of friendship and growing
  up. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
